## Automation & Tools

### Development Commands
- `/test-auto` - Run full test suite after changes
- `/code-review` - AI code review before commits  
- `/performance-check` - Weekly performance audit
- `/security-scan` - Security vulnerability check

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: CI/CD
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    # Run tests, linting, type checking
  build:
    # Build application for deployment
  deploy:
    # Deploy to staging/production
```

### Monitoring Setup
- **Health Checks**: Automated endpoint monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Automatic error reporting
- **Performance**: Response time and throughput tracking
- **Logs**: Centralized logging with search

## Risk Management

### High-Impact Risks

#### Technical Complexity
- **Risk**: Features more complex than estimated
- **Mitigation**: Break down into smaller tasks, prototype early
- **Contingency**: Reduce scope, focus on core MVP

#### Performance Issues
- **Risk**: Application doesn't meet performance targets
- **Mitigation**: Performance testing from M1, optimization in M3
- **Contingency**: Architecture adjustments, caching layers

#### Integration Problems
- **Risk**: Third-party services unreliable or difficult
- **Mitigation**: Mock implementations, fallback strategies
- **Contingency**: Alternative services, simplified integrations
